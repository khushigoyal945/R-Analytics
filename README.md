Retail Store Inventory Analysis: Sales and Performance Insights

This project deepened my passion for data and showcased how actionable insights can drive smarter inventory management strategies. Designed for use in R Studio, it focuses on data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. The approach is ideal for building dashboards, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating predictive models using packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, and caret.

Key Highlights of the Project:

Inventory Analysis: Identified trends in stock turnover and high-demand product categories.
Profitability Insights: Evaluated the effects of markdowns and supply chain decisions on margins.
Stock Segmentation: Examined inventory needs across various store departments and customer segments.
Tools and Techniques Used:

R Programming: Leveraged dplyr and tidyverse for data manipulation and modeling.
Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards to facilitate inventory optimization.
Predictive Modeling: Forecasted stock requirements using advanced statistical techniques.
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can streamline retail operations and enhance profitability.
